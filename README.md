Digit Recognizer AI with GUI 

This project is a simple digit recognition application using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The user can draw digits on the screen 
and get predictions in real-time via a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

*Features

- Handwritten digit recognition (0â€“9)
- Trained on MNIST dataset
- GUI for drawing digits

*Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
